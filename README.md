# LoR Deck Name Editor
This page was originally created by [Dagrotus](https://github.com/Dagrotus/dagrotus.github.io). Usually, I was content with posting the sprite sheets to Reddit, but now that they stopped maintaining the project at the end of 2021, I feel like I have to update this.

# Contributions
I myself will keep the sprites updated and the basic functionality working. Occasionally, I'll do small updates aimed at usability, but I'll keep the general structure intact. There is no plan to completely overhaul the page, but if someone does, I'll gladly help out there with the sprites and tags.

Other contributions are welcome, but I don't really expect them. Unless you're a UI/UX designer, then come here _immediately_.

## Extracting the Sprites
If you're interested in extracting these sprites or other game files yourself, try [AssetStudio](https://github.com/Perfare/AssetStudio). The bundle structure can be overwhelming at first, but luckily, there is a list at `LoR\live\PatcherData\PatchableFiles\AssetBundles\AssetToBundleMap.txt` that tells you what file can be found where.

## Reddit Posts
Here's a list of Reddit posts I made on the topic. It includes several variations of the sprite sheets the game uses, as well as some other tags and tricks that can be used.
